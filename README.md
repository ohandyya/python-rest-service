# Activity Recommender: A simple python machine learning REST service

## Goal

- In this pet project, I want to implement a activity recommender as a REST service.

- The goal is to learn and to get familar with the technology stacks for building a machine learning REST service, and not about the machine learning algorihtm itself.

## Description

- User can provide his/her gender, and the service will return a recommended activity, e.g., basketball, for the user. The recommendation wil be based on the conditional probability of each activity for that gender.

- User can update the activity database, that is, the number of male players and female players for each activity.
